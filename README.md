## Vaccination

The `vaccinated` column shows the percent of the CT population that has received at least one vaccination dose. The state did not properly track early vaccinations (which took place starting in December of 2020, so the estimates begin at around 20%. Furthermore the vaccination percentage climbs to more than 100%, presumably because the number vaccinated exceeds the population of the state estimated in the last U.S. Census.
